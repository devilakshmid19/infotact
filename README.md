# 📊 Customer Segmentation using Data Science

## 📝 Project Description
The **Customer Segmentation** project aims to categorize a company's customer base into distinct groups to better understand their behaviors and preferences. By leveraging **various datasets**, we analyze key customer attributes such as purchasing behavior, demographics, and financial impact. This helps businesses tailor personalized marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

We use **K-Means Clustering** and other clustering techniques to group customers based on their common characteristics. The final segments are visualized and validated to ensure they align with business objectives.
