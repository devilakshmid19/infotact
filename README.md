# 📊 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📝 Project Description
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to perform **customer segmentation** based on various features. The goal is to analyze customer behavior and categorize them into distinct groups to provide valuable business insights.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:
- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  
- Other relevant demographic & behavioral data  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for K-Means clustering)  

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values (if any)  
   - Normalize/scale numerical features  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
   
2. **Applying K-Means Clustering**  
   - Finding the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method  
   - Implementing K-Means and fitting the data  
   - Visualizing clustered data  

3. **Insights & Interpretation**  
   - Understanding cluster characteristics  
   - Business applications of the findings  

## 📊 Results & Visualizations
- Cluster distribution plots  
- Customer segmentation insights based on different features  
- Interpretation of customer behavior patterns  

## 🔥 How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/devilakshmid19/infotact.git
